Description: This is an R package for interfacing with the
    BIOM format. This package includes basic tools for
    reading biom-format files, accessing and subsetting
    data tables from a biom object (which is more complex
    than a single table), as well as limited support for
    writing a biom-object back to a biom-format file. The
    design of this API is intended to match the python API
    and other tools included with the biom-format project,
    but with a decidedly "R flavor" that should be familiar
    to R users. This includes S4 classes and methods, as
    well as extensions of common core functions/methods.
